# CONTRIBUTING

First, thank you for contributing!

I love pull requests from everyone.

Here are a few technical guidelines to follow:

1. Open an issue to discuss a new feature.
1. Write tests.
1. Make sure the entire test suite passes locally and on CI.
1. Open a Pull Request to receive feedback.
1. Party!

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Run `bundle exec rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/hack` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
